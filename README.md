# AI & ML Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning journey and hands-on practice in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** using **Python**.  
It includes Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental concepts, experiments, and small projects as part of my coursework and self-study.

I am a **B.Tech AI & ML student**, and this repository is meant to track my progress, experiments, and understanding of ML concepts.
